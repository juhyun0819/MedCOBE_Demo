    "explanation": "The correct diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis is a chronic granulomatous vasculitis that affects the tunica media of medium/large arteries and produces narrowing, stenosis, and aneurysmal dilatation of aorta and its branches.1In this patient, narrowing of whole length of the renal artery from its origin, involvement of ostia, and thickening of the wall of aorta favored the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis. Atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia are the common causes of renovascular hypertension in adults and children, respectively.2Atherosclerosis is characterized by presence of atheroma at the bifurcation of the renal artery and abdominal aorta. Absence of atheroma at origin of the renal artery and narrowing of its whole length is against atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory vascular disease that mainly affects coronary and renal arteries. It rarely affects the aorta and involves the distal part of the renal artery and spares ostia.3Moyamoya disease is a nonatherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease that presents with supraclinoid stenosis of internal carotid arteries and produces extensive collaterals. Children present with moyamoya disease with cerebral ischemic events whereas adults may present with cerebral ischemia or intracerebral hemorrhage. Moyamoya disease may present with renovascular hypertension in 5% to 8% children and 28.8% in adults.4Moyamoya disease affects one-third of the length of the main renal artery and spares the ostia and rarely involves aorta.5 Takayasu arteritis is rarely associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. It presents with an early systemic phase characterized by malaise, myalgia, weight loss, and fever, and the late vaso-occlusive phase that manifests with stroke, syncope, limb claudication, pulselessness, hypertension, and vascular bruit. Early systemic manifestations are usually missed in children. Headache, cardiomyopathy, kidney failure, and systolic hypertension are significantly more common in children compared with adults.1The markers of inflammation-like raised C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, β-2-microglobulin, haptoglobin, and orosomucoid are elevated. However, there are not diagnostic of Takayasu arteritis.1Takayasu arteritis should be suspected in any child that presents with hypertension or its complications. Diagnosis is usually based on presence of hypertension, pulse deficit or claudication, blood pressure discrepancies in limbs, bruits, and angiographic abnormalities. The updated consensus criteria for diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis requires angiographic abnormality (aneurysm/dilatation, narrowing, occlusion, or thickened arterial wall) of the aorta or its main branches, coronaries, or pulmonary arteries not because of fibromuscular dysplasia or similar causes.6Differential diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis includes giant-cell arteritis that involves large vessels in adults, medium-sized vasculitis with cross-symptomatology, like Kawasaki disease that involves coronaries, polyarteritis nodosa with mesenteric, and kidney involvement and systemic lupus erythematosus. The treatment of Takayasu arteritis includes control of hypertension, oral glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressants to control the disease activity, aspirin, and specific treatment of vaso-occlusive disease. This child showed recovery from headache and adequate control of hypertension while receiving amlodipine and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. He was given oral corticosteroids and not offered kidney angioplasty due to poor function of the right kidney on diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is rare in children, mostly seen in the setting of acute lymphocytic leukemia during the induction phase of chemotherapy or rarely during hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. Cerebral autodysregulation due to hypertension produces vasodilatation and widening of endothelial tight junctions that produces vasogenic edema, predominantly in the occipital region due to relative lack of sympathetic fibers around arteries of posterior circulation. Headaches, seizures, and altered mental status are the main clinical features.7Takayasu arteritis frequently presents with hypertension in children, which makes it an ideal setting for the development of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome."
