    "scenario": "A 46-year-old man presented with a left shoulder mass. It began with a quarter-size maculopapular lesion and continued to progress during the next 3 years. He reported limited shoulder movements and denied other symptoms. There was no medical or surgical history, and he had a negative personal or familial oncologic history. The patient was a construction worker and used tobacco daily. On physical examination, there was a 24 × 15-cm fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated left shoulder mass (Figure 1A). A punch biopsy showed sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells. A whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan revealed an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases (Figure 1B). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for intracranial metastasis.",

    "explanation": "The biomarker SOX10 is highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing melanoma,1in conjunction with histologic findings and negative keratin staining, making melanoma the most likely diagnosis. Mutational testing revealed noBRAFor other sequence variations. An outside hospital staged the patient’s melanoma as cT4bN2bM0 (stage IIIC) and recommended a clinical trial of pembrolizumab plus cabozantinib for unresectable melanoma. After 10 cycles of treatment, there was continued local progression but slightly decreased uptake on a positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan. The patient then received weekly local immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec injections in the later course for 6 weeks with further progression. The patient presented to our center for a second opinion before proceeding with palliative radiotherapy. Although radiotherapy has beneficial outcomes in adjuvant and palliative settings,2,3our multidisciplinary team recommended resection and reconstruction, followed by adjuvant therapy. The patient underwent left shoulder mass radical resection, including muscles, partial scapulectomy, left complete axillary lymph node dissection, and immediate lymphatic reconstruction (a microsurgical technique to reconnect lymphatics after nodal dissection to lower the risk of lymphedema). The muscles were imbricated over the pared-down scapular spine, and a collagen glycosaminoglycan dermal substitute was placed. Reconstruction was completed with a split-thickness skin graft. Surgical pathologic findings revealed invasive melanoma involving adjacent skeletal muscles, and it was 22.2 cm in its greatest dimension. All 33 resected axillary lymph nodes were normal, with no evidence of previously treated melanoma (ypT4bN0M0). Two years after resection, he had a well-healed skin graft with full range of motion and no evidence of lymphedema, and he returned to work in construction (Figure 2). He completed 1 year of adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy with no adverse events; his most recent systemic imaging showed no evidence of disease. Locally advanced fungating melanomas are rare, and the anatomical location and size can pose challenges in management. There are case reports of fungating melanomas, mainly in the upper and lower extremities, and the treatment plans and outcomes varied in these cases.4,5In the present case, because of the lack of surgical evaluation on initial presentation at the outside hospital, possible curative resection and nodal evaluation were not performed promptly. The patient did not have good clinical response to pembrolizumab plus cabozantinib in the trial; however, the subsequent imaging showed reduced uptake in the mass and axillary nodes. On histologic results, the left axillary lymph nodes were pathologically enlarged, but no pathologic metastases were observed; rather, there were reactive lymph nodes. A possible explanation is that there might never have been metastases in the axillary lymph nodes, and an initial axillary biopsy could have been pursued. Another theory could be that there was pathologic response. The original clinical trial could be considered as neoadjuvant therapy after our resection, and the treatment plan could have been further tailored on the basis of index lymph node response in the light of the PRADO (Personalized Response-Directed Surgery and Adjuvant Therapy After Neoadjuvant Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in High-Risk Stage III Melanoma) trial results.6-8In addition, there are emerging clinical data on neoadjuvant treatments for advanced melanoma.9,10The SWOG (Southwest Oncology Group) S1801 study, a phase 2 trial, reported that neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy improved event-free survival compared with standard adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy in high-risk resectable melanomas.10 In conclusion, this educational case challenge demonstrates a rare presentation of a common malignant tumor. Multidisciplinary discussion is crucial for solidifying the best therapeutic options for patients with advanced melanomas. Surgical evaluation and lymph node pathologic information are crucial to tailor the plan."
