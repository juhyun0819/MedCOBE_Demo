The enhancement encases the optic nerves and extends to the cavernous sinus. There is abnormal dural enhancement in the right middle cranial fossa and the right sphenoid wing (arrowhead).",
    "scenario": "A Black woman in her early 70s with a history of coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass operations, hypertension, and colon polyps presented to oculoplastic surgery with 1 week of progressive right-sided proptosis and headache, described as severe pain radiating to the back of her head. This was associated with right eyelid ptosis and blurry vision. Prior to presentation, an outside ophthalmologist treated her with 1 week of oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, for presumed orbital inflammation with no improvement. She denied additional symptoms. Notably, she described headache and sudden vision loss in the right eye after coronary artery bypass grafting 1 year ago for several days before spontaneous improvement with incomplete resolution. Personal and family histories were negative for malignant neoplasm and autoimmune disease. Examination revealed right-sided uncorrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/60 associated with restricted supraduction, abduction, and infraduction. Pupils were equal in size without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 10 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. Visual fields had temporal restriction to confrontation of the right eye. Vision, motility, and visual fields were normal on the left. Pertinent findings included right-sided proptosis of 2 mm, cranial nerve V1 and V2 hypoesthesia, eyelid ptosis with a margin to reflex distance 1 of 0 mm, optic disc pallor, and vessel attenuation. Outside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an infiltrative mass involving right greater than left orbital apices, the right optic nerve, and right extraocular muscles. There was enhancement of the cavernous sinuses, right pterygopalatine fossa, right sphenoid wing, and right middle cranial fossa dura (Figure 1).",

    "explanation": "C. Perform urgent orbital exploration and biopsy The differential diagnosis for proptosis with motility restriction in adults includes neoplasms, infectious and noninfectious orbital inflammation, trauma, and vascular abnormalities. The most common cause is thyroid eye disease, associated with eyelid retraction (90% of cases), exophthalmos (60%), and motility restrictions (40%).1Orbital inflammatory conditions typically present with pain, soft tissue edema, and steroid response.2The patient had no history of orbital inflammatory disease to warrant restarting corticosteroids (choice A) without workup, especially in the setting of an infiltrative orbital mass with intracranial involvement. A new orbital mass in an older adult warrants investigation to rule out a malignant neoplasm, including lymphoproliferative disease, melanoma, and metastases.2MRI demonstrated an enhancing infiltrative lesion predominantly involving the right orbit, cavernous sinuses, right sphenoid wing, and right middle cranial fossa dura. Common spheno-orbital lesions include meningiomas and metastases; an enhancing dural tail on MRI is a classic feature of meningioma.3Meningioma management consists of microsurgery, radiosurgery, and radiotherapy (choice D) after tissue diagnosis.4In this case, orbital exploration and biopsy (choice C) would obtain tissue with less morbidity and surgical risk than craniotomy. Neurosurgery (choice B) would be indicated for management of a biopsy-proven tumor. Biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomas, chronic inflammation with no fungi or acid-fast organisms, and rare immunoglobulin G4–positive cells (Figure 2). Serology was negative for granulomatous disease; radiography was negative for hilar lymphadenopathy. Neurosarcoidosis was diagnosed based on the presence of noncaseating granulomas on tissue biopsy and negative workup for other granulomatous disease. The patient began oral prednisone, 40 mg/d, which alleviated her symptoms, and she established care with the sarcoidosis clinic for evaluation and surveillance. Sarcoidosis, an immune-mediated condition characterized by noncaseating granulomas in various organs, presents at a mean age of 48 years and incidence of 35.5 cases per 100 000 Black individuals and 10.9 cases per 100 000 White individuals in the US.5Diagnosis is made through (1) demonstration of noncaseating granulomas on tissue and exclusion of other disease or (2) presentation as a pathognomonic syndrome, such as Lofgren syndrome, lupus pernio, or Heerfordt syndrome.6 Ophthalmic involvement, the first clinical sign in 20% to 30% of cases, usually presents with anterior uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis, or sicca syndrome.7Uveoparotid fever, or Heerfordt syndrome, manifests with facial palsy, parotid gland enlargement, uveitis, and fever.6,7Neurosarcoidosis affects 3% to 10% of cases, of which 84% to 94% have additional systemic involvement.6Isolated neurosarcoidosis and simultaneous orbital and intracranial involvement are rare features of this case. Of 11 cases of cavernous sinus involvement reported, only 2 had concurrent orbital inflammation.8,9 Initial treatment typically consists of oral prednisone, 0.25 to 1 mg/kg/d. This patient’s initial dose of 20 mg/d was subtherapeutic given her weight (97.5 kg). Many cases require additional agents, and severe cases may require prolonged immunosuppression.10Visual prognosis is favorable with treatment.7 At 4-month follow-up after completing a prednisone taper, the patient’s headaches had resolved. Examination revealed visual acuity of 20/60 OD, improved motility deficits, full visual field, and resolution of proptosis with symmetric ophthalmometric measurements. She remained stable without corticosteroids at 6-month follow-up."
